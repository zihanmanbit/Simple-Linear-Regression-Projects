# Simple Linear Regression Projects 📈

This repository contains two beginner-friendly machine learning projects based on **Simple Linear Regression**, guided by the Coursera project course: ["Simple Linear Regression for the Absolute Beginner"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/simple-linear-regression-for-the-absolute-beginner)

---

## 🔍 Overview

Simple Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between a **dependent variable (Y)** and an **independent variable (X)**. These projects demonstrate how to:

- Perform data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering
- Build and evaluate simple linear regression models using **Scikit-learn**
- Apply linear regression to real-world problems

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🍦 Ice Cream Revenue Prediction
**Problem**: Predict daily revenue ($) based on outside air temperature (°C).

- **Independent Variable (X)**: Outside Air Temperature
- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: Daily Revenue
- 📄 Notebook: [`Simple_Linear_Regression_Revenue_Generation.ipynb`](https://github.com/zihanmanbit/Simple-Linear-Regression-Projects/blob/main/Simple_Linear_Regression_Revenue_Generation.ipynb)

### 2. 🚗 Fuel Consumption Prediction
**Problem**: Predict mileage per gallon (MPG) based on vehicle horsepower (HP).

- **Independent Variable (X)**: Horsepower
- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: MPG (Fuel Efficiency)
